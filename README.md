# iEXMultiSender

This DAPP is used to send TRX to many addresses in one transaction, that can help you to save much more TX fee. Just upload JSON file with addresses and balances that you want to send. Select a address and sent thousands of addresses out in 1 minute.

2. Make sure your TronLink is pointed to the network that you would like to use.
3. Make sure your TronLink account is unlocked.
4. Go to https://multisender.iexbase.com
5. Wait for the full page to load.
6. Select a address from the dropdown that you would like to send.
7. Provide either JSON text in the textarea (see example below).
8. Click continue.
9. If everything looks good, click next once again.
10. Wait for TronLink to generate an approval transaction.
11. Once the approval transaction is mined, TronLink will generate as many transactions as needed for your TRX transfers.
12. Done!

You can test this tool on any test network, if you want to make sure that
everything will work as expected.
